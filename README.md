# Tic Tac Toe

##Constraints
1. Upon initial page render, the player who starts is randomly generated
2. After winning a game, clicking the 'Play Again' button will start a new game with the previous current player as the player that starts the new game. Making it'loser starts' upon each subsequent game.
3. The game description did not mention needing to keep player1 or player2's score so that feature was not implemented

##Tech Stack
1. Front End - ReactJS, Styled-Components, Babel, Webpack
2. Back End - NodeJS with Express
3. No apparent need for database to persist data

##Instructions
To run webpack and start the server:

Webpack: npm run build
Server: npm run start
